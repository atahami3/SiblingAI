## How this works
- We mainly focus on two important folders, which are pages and data. Pages folder has sub folders where the js files are developed.
- The index.js is for designing website.
- The chat.js is for the conversation with the user.
- The learn.js is for managing its data for AI's brain.
- The clear.js is for clearing the conversation and the data in the brain.js
- The other folder called data that is for AI's memory. The brain.js is the brain of the AI where it will be learning from the user and is being managed by the learn.js.
